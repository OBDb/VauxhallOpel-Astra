    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Astra K represented the seventh generation of the popular European compact car, built on General Motors' D2XX platform before the brands' acquisition by PSA Group (later Stellantis). Available in five-door hatchback and estate (Sports Tourer) body styles, the Astra K featured more dynamic styling with sharp creases, a floating roof effect on some models, and a more athletic stance than its predecessor. Significantly lighter than the previous generation—up to 200 kg (440 lbs) in some configurations—the Astra K offered improved efficiency and driving dynamics. Engine options included a range of petrol and diesel units, with the petrol lineup featuring 1.0, 1.4, and 1.6-liter turbocharged engines producing between 105 and 200 horsepower, while diesel options included 1.6 and 2.0-liter units with outputs ranging from 110 to 160 horsepower. Transmission choices included six-speed manual, automated manual, and conventional automatic options. The interior saw a significant upgrade in design and technology, featuring a driver-focused cockpit with a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available OnStar connectivity services (until 2019), and improved materials throughout. Advanced features for the segment included optional IntelliLux LED matrix headlights, adaptive cruise control, and automated parking assistance. The Astra K achieved critical acclaim, winning the European Car of the Year award in 2016, and maintained a strong position in the competitive compact car segment through its combination of value, technology, and driving dynamics, though facing increasing competition from SUVs and crossovers that were steadily eroding traditional hatchback sales across Europe."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Astra L represents the eighth generation of the compact family car and the first developed under Stellantis ownership after the PSA Group's acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis EMP2 platform shared with vehicles like the Peugeot 308, the Astra L features bold, distinctive styling adopting the new 'Vizor' front end design—a blacked-out panel integrating the headlights and grille into a single visual element—and more angular, assertive proportions. Available in five-door hatchback and estate (Sports Tourer) body styles, with crossover-inspired variants planned, the Astra L maintains similar dimensions to its predecessor while offering improved interior space and technology. Powertrain options reflect Stellantis's electrification strategy, including traditional petrol and diesel engines alongside plug-in hybrid variants. Petrol options include 1.2-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engines with 110 or 130 horsepower, while diesel is represented by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder producing 130 horsepower. The plug-in hybrid combines a 1.6-liter petrol engine with an electric motor for a combined output of up to 225 horsepower, offering approximately 35 miles of electric-only range. A fully electric Astra Electric variant joined the lineup in 2023, featuring a 156 horsepower motor and 54 kWh battery providing approximately 258 miles of range. The interior demonstrates a significant technological leap with the Pure Panel digital cockpit combining dual 10-inch screens for instruments and infotainment, wireless smartphone integration, and improved materials throughout. Advanced driver assistance systems include semi-automated lane changing, adaptive cruise control, and 360-degree parking cameras. The Astra L aims to strengthen Vauxhall/Opel's position in the competitive compact car segment by offering distinctive design, electrified powertrains, and cutting-edge technology, while leveraging the engineering and component sharing benefits of the wider Stellantis group."
