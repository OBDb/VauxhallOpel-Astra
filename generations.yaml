    description: "The Opel Astra F was the first generation of the Astra nameplate, launched in September 1991 as a direct replacement for the Opel Kadett E. Built on the T-body platform, it was offered as a three- or five-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and five-door estate (Caravan). The Astra F grew slightly in all dimensions compared to the Kadett, with a windshield moved forward by 33mm and roof extended at the rear, significantly increasing interior volume. The model received a cosmetic facelift in 1994 with improved rust protection, new grille with larger Opel badge, clear front turn signals, and updated door mirrors. While production in Germany ended in 2000, Polish-built Astras continued as the Astra Classic until 2003 in Central and Eastern European markets. Engine options ranged from 1.4 to 2.0 liters in petrol (including the high-performance 2.0L 16V GSi with DOHC C20XE engine) and 1.7 liters in diesel. A cabriolet version was designed and built by Bertone in Italy. The Astra F won the Semperit Irish Car of the Year in 1992 and South African Car of the Year in 1994 and 1995."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Astra K represented the fifth generation of the popular European compact car, built on General Motors' D2XX platform before the brands' acquisition by PSA Group (later Stellantis). Officially unveiled on 1 June 2015 and premiered at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the Astra K is 5cm smaller but offers more interior space than its predecessor. Significantly lighter—up to 200 kg (440 lbs) in some configurations—the weight reduction came from a bodyshell reduced by 20% from 357 to 280 kilograms using high-strength and ultra-high-strength steels. Available in five-door hatchback and estate (Sports Tourer) body styles, the Astra K featured more dynamic styling with sharp creases and a floating roof effect on some models. Engine options included 1.0-liter three-cylinder and 1.4-liter four-cylinder petrol engines (1.2L and 1.3L from 2019) or 1.6-liter 'whisper diesel', with turbocharged petrol engines using direct injection. Transmission choices included five or six-speed manual, the new 5-speed EasyTronic 3.0 automated manual, and 6-speed automatic. The interior featured a standard 7-inch or optional 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, available OnStar services (until 2019), and improved materials throughout. Advanced features included optional IntelliLux LED matrix headlights, adaptive cruise control, and automated parking assistance. The Astra K won the European Car of the Year award in 2016."

    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Astra L represents the sixth generation of the compact family car and the first developed under Stellantis ownership after the PSA Group's acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis EMP2 platform shared with vehicles like the Peugeot 308, the Astra L features bold, distinctive styling adopting the new 'Vizor' front end design—a blacked-out panel integrating the headlights and grille into a single visual element—and more angular, assertive proportions. Available in five-door hatchback and estate (Sports Tourer) body styles, the Astra L maintains similar dimensions to its predecessor while offering improved interior space and technology. Powertrain options reflect Stellantis's electrification strategy, including traditional petrol and diesel engines alongside plug-in hybrid variants. Petrol options include 1.2-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engines with 110 or 130 horsepower, while diesel is represented by a 1.5-liter four-cylinder producing 130 horsepower. The plug-in hybrid combines a 1.6-liter petrol engine with an electric motor for a combined output of up to 225 horsepower, offering approximately 35 miles of electric-only range. A fully electric Astra Electric variant joined the lineup in 2023, featuring a 156 horsepower motor and 54 kWh battery providing approximately 258 miles of range. The interior demonstrates a significant technological leap with the Pure Panel digital cockpit combining dual 10-inch screens for instruments and infotainment, wireless smartphone integration, and improved materials throughout. Advanced driver assistance systems include semi-automated lane changing, adaptive cruise control, and 360-degree parking cameras."
